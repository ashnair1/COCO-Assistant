<h1> Installation </h1>

## Stable release

To install COCO-Assistant, run this command in your
terminal:

``` console
$ pip install coco-assistant
```

This is the preferred method to install COCO-Assistant, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.

## From source

The source for COCO-Assistant can be downloaded from
the [Github repo][].
